# Jacob Williams 50 - Week 3

## The work I did for this homework cycle...
This was not an easy lesson, I'll say that.  I was given three JavasScript problems and had to solve them using materials I have learned from the online textbook.  Throughout the lesson, I have learned about/ reviewed; values, data types, operators, and program structure.

## Work Process/ Cycle
As usual, I went over the lesson on the course website before starting my homework.  After that, I got into the online textbook, and gave some of the coding examples a try to make sure that I was understanding the content okay.  When I dove into the assignment exercises, however, I had a hard time trying to figure out the program structure and what I was trying to create.  Whenever I checked my answers and noticed that their incorrect, I took some more time reread and understand the functions until I could figure out how to write a code of my own.  I also took notes for this week's contents, so that I can better understand them in my own way.

## Class Issues
I had a hard time trying to learn this week's contents yes, though I didn't think it was necessary to post it on the issues site.  I figured that I would eventually learn and figure it out on my own.

Also, I could not find any other issues from my classmates for me to help out with (in fact, there were hardly any posted issues at all).

## Weekly Conclusion
Again, not an easy lesson.  Though it was interesting to learn some new stuff.  I am aware that I still have much to learn, but I will always have the link to the textbook and my notes to back me up if I ever need to take some time to review.  I'm also aware that I cannot test them, as I do not have a web console, so I'll just turn in what I have, and hope for the best.
