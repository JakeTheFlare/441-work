# Jacob Williams 50 - Week 7

This was definitely a tricky assignment.  I was tasked with creating an HTML page that would serve as a "Choose Your Own Adventure" site.  This allowed me to review everything from the previous homework assignment, but with the addition of some new stuff I learned like; Callbacks, Events, and Forms.  I have read the lesson contents over a dozen times, and I got a pretty slight understanding of everything.  Though I still feel like I'll need more practice with it all in the future.

Of course, I did have some issues along the way.  Mainly, the part where I try to make the whole page display new content whenever a decision has been made.  I posted that issue on the Discord website, and my fellow classmate, Jon Swallow, was happy to help me by allowing me to view what he did with his site.  That helped a lot, and I learned about a new useful tool in web design, the ability to show and hide div tags.  For example; 'divname.hidden.true' or 'divname.hidden.false'.  I did not have any helpful information to give to my colleagues with their issues, not that they had much to post anyway.

Though I got most of what I wanted for my assignment, I did leave one technical glitch.  One reason, was because I just didn't know how to fix it.  And, more importantly, I just got tired of spending too much time working on the project.  So I'll just give Micheal what I have and hope that I can still get a decent grade out of it.  All in all, this was a pretty tough, but interesting assignment.  It just seems pretty fun to make sites like this, and I hope that next week will have something just as engaging.

(Now that I think about it, I probably should've done something more interesting and less random like a detective case.  Oh well.  I'm happy with what I did.)
