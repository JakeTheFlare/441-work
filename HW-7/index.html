            <p>You have used the Metal of Radiance to craft the enchanted sword.  With it, the knight was successful with his quest to rescue the princess, and slay the dragon.  As a reward, you were offered a job as the official royal blacksmith.  And as a result, you have been earned a better pay, a better house, and a family of your very own.  With that, you have become proud of the path you have chosen, thanks to your father, and you live happily ever after.  The End</p>
