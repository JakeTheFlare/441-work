# Jacob Williams 50 - Week 6

This was a pretty light, but interesting week.  I was tasked with creating a simple webpage by way of adjusting the DOM API and the Selector API in Javascript.  In addition, I was not allowed to make it by altering the html document.  At first I felt a little overwhelmed, since this was usually how I prefer to do web design.  But as I got into the reading and the lesson content on the class site, it all started to make sense to me.  Creating nodes, using innerText to replace text on a webpage, and using the setAttribute function to style them, it all felt like a brand new game, and it was fun to.

I ran into some issues while working on the assignment, but I managed to pull through by getting in touch with my fellow students on Discord.  The main problems I had were; how to get started with my code, how to create other elements, and how to place images.  Besides Discord and my readings, I also looked up some hints on W3Schools, a very helpful web design and coding site that I would highly recommend to my fellow students.  In addition, I helped out some of the others with their problems as well.  (Kind of sad, knowing that the Issues page will hardly be needed anymore.)

It was nice getting a break for a change.  I have learned a lot from this week, and I hope to use these newfound skills at some point in the future.  I hope that the next upcoming weeks will be just as fluent as this one.
