# Jacob Williams 50 - Week 2

## The work I did for this homework cycle...
Not a very difficult week.  My assignment was to create a basic webpage, that inserts a string of pre-formatted markup into the webpage, using the document.write() function.

## Work Process/ Cycle
Like last week, I started out by reading over all the lesson's contents before starting my homework assignment, just to make sure everything was clear.  This was an easy assignment, it only took me a few minutes to understand everything and have a webpage all laid out.  And, as always, I tested the page to make sure everything worked alright.

## Class Issues
I actually did not have any issues at all for this week.

As for some of my other classmates...  I could not find any issues to help out with this week.

`I guess this was an easy assignment for everyone.`

## Weekly Conclusion
I have done an assignment like this in the past (Web Development or Creative Coding, can't remember which one), and it was nice getting to review and learn more about JavaScript in the process.  I am looking forward to learning more further on in this course.
