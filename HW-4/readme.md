# Jacob Williams 50 - Week 4

## The work I did for this homework cycle...
For this week, I was given five more JavasScript problems and had to solve them using what I have read in chapters 3-5 in the online textbook.  I have learned more about functions and console.log throughout the lesson, though I think that I still need a little more practice with them in the future.

## Work Process/ Cycle
Throughout my work process, I have read over the lessons in the online textbook, and then dove into the coding exercises to give them a try.  Whenever I was unsure about the correct answer, or if my written answer was incorrect, I took some more time reread and understand the functions until I could figure out how to write a code of my own.  I usually do not condone to writing something down until I fully understand it.

## Class Issues
The first problem of the homework assignment, the one where I was suppose to create a simple function definition, was the one I had trouble understanding the most, so I posted it on the issues site to see if I could receive some help.  A few of my fellow students were kind enough to give me some advice on the problem.

A fellow student had some trouble on the third problem, letter counting.  I offered them some little advice on how to improve their code, though I doubt that it was any useful help.

## Weekly Conclusion
Another tough week, but I managed.  Even though I have tested all of my codes, I am not entirely sure that they're all written the way Micheal Musick wants us to write them.  Just have hope for the best, I guess.
