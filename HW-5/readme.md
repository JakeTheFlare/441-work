# Jacob Williams 50 - Week 5

## The work I did for this homework cycle...
For this week, I was given three more JavasScript problems and had to solve them using what I have read in chapters 6 & 8 in the online textbook.

## Work Process/ Cycle
This was not an easy week.  Even after reading the and trying out some of the exercises from the lessons in the online textbook, I just got stumped a bunch of times.  I viewed the answers if I was unsure about something, and to get a better understanding of what I was either doing wrong, or did not understand.  I have scoured all across the web to see if I could find any hints on those problems, I found some useful hints on the W3Schools site, and they slightly helped.

## Class Issues
I was definitely having trouble with the lesson, so I have tried Discord for the very first time to see if my fellow students could give me a hand.  It was then, however, that everyone else was kind of having trouble to.  Sadly, I could not contribute any help to them as well.
