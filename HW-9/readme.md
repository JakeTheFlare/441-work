# Jacob Williams 50 - Week 9

I wouldn't say that this week wasn't interesting, just a hell of a lot to take in.  I've spent just about all the time I had trying to understand how API's work, and a lot of the sources I found on the class site and on the web didn't really make a lot of sense to me.  I thought I could turn to some of my other fellow students' work as reference guides, though I was a little confused on those to.  So in general, this wasn't necessarily my best week, and I don't really feel like I gave it my best effort. ;( And honestly, I'm not so sure if my API link works or not.  I'll just turn in what I have and hope for the best.
